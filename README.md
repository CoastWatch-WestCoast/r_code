# R Notebooks for the CoastWatch Satellite Training Course  

These files are the R Notebooks for the CoastWatch Satellite Course R Tutorials 

## Exercise book contents  
The Notebooks contain step-by-step code examples for extracting data from the ERDDAP data servers using the rxtracto R library.  
* [Extract data within a boundary](extract_data_marine_sanctuary.md)   
In this exercise, you will download data from within the boundaries of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) and visualize the data in a map.  

* [Matchups satellite data to an animal tracks](matchup_satellite_track_data.md)  
This exercise you will extract satellite data around a set of points defined by longitude, latitude, and time coordinates like that produced by an animal telemetry tag, a ship track, or a glider tract.  

* [Create timeseries from satellite data](timeseries_satellite_data.md)  
This excercise extracts a time series of monthly satellite chlorophyll data for the period of 1997-present from four different monthly satellite datasets.  

* [Matchup satellite to buoy data](matchup_satellite_buoy_data.md)  
In this exercise you will extract buoy data from ERDDAP tabular data and then extract satellite data that is coincident with the buoy data.  

* [Define a marine habitat](define_marine_habitat.md)  
In this exercise you will plot the thermal boundary of loggerhead sea turtles using satellite sea surface temperature.  

* [Reprojecting satellite and buoy data](reprojecting_satellite_buoy_data.md)  
In exercise, we will obtain cruise track data from a research ship, in-situ buoy data, and satellite sea surface temperature data from the PolarWatch ERDDAP data server and then plot all three types of the data on a map in an Alaska Albers projection.  

* [Accessing projected datasets](accessing_projected_datasets.md)  
This excercise demonstrates techniques for working with sea ice data served in polar stereographic map projection.
